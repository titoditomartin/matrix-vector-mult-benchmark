# Matrix Vector Multiplication Testing Benchmark

## Testing

Run and Output:
![TestOutput](images/test output)

Since there are no errors, that means that the testing function works and the function used is successful.

## Benchmark 

### Time complexity

Run and Output:
![TimeComplexityOutput](images/time output)

As you can see, the time takes to complete running the program obviously increases as the value of N increases as well. That data is visualized using this graph:

![TimeComplexityResult](images/time)

### Space complexity

Run and Output:
![SpaceComplexityOutput1](images/WhatsApp Image 2022-12-09 at 16.08.25)
![SpaceComplexityOutput2](images/WhatsApp Image 2022-12-09 at 16.18.38)
![SpaceComplexityOutput3](images/WhatsApp Image 2022-12-09 at 16.20.58)

As you can see, the space it takes while running the program obviously also increases as the value of N increases. That data is also visualized using a graph:

![SpaceComplexityResult](images/space)
