# Matrix Vector Multiplication Testing Benchmark

## Testing

Run and Output:
![TestOutput](images/test output.jpeg)

Since there are no errors, that means that the testing function works and the function used is successful.

## Benchmark 

### Time complexity

Run and Output:
![TimeComplexityOutput](images/timeoutput.png)

As you can see, the time takes to complete running the program obviously increases as the value of N increases as well. That data is visualized using this graph:

![TimeComplexityResult](images/TimeGraph.png)

### Space complexity

Run and Output:
![SpaceComplexityOutput1](images/spaceoutput1.png)
![SpaceComplexityOutput2](images/spaceoutput2.png)
![SpaceComplexityOutput3](images/spaceoutput3.png)

As you can see, the space it takes while running the program obviously also increases as the value of N increases. That data is also visualized using a graph:
